# oasis Core v2.1.0

## Summary
This major upgrade brings a large set of new features to oasis Core; Users can now:
- see the USD value of their available XOS directly within oasis Core.
- use the `burn` command to permanently embed custom data on-chain, or simply burn XOS from the circulating supply.
- use the `getblockchaininfo` or `getinfo` commands to see the total "burned" XOS.
- see burns within the GUI, displayed by a coloured "oasis flame" icon, the TX list can also be 'filtered' by burns.
- use the `reloadmasternodeconfig` command to hot-reload their masternode.conf file, without restarting their wallet.

Additionally, this release contains a major patch for upstream exploit: CVE-2018-17145, also known as [INVDoS](https://invdos.net/), oasis Core is also more stable, crash-resistant and hardened by a multitude of bugfixes.

## How to Upgrade
_oasis Core v2.1.0 is a **non-consensus-breaking** update. In other words, you are not required to upgrade, but it is highly recommended. The reasons it is strongly encouraged for users to upgrade is because it will further secure your wallet with bugfixes and exploit patches, alongside new features that the oasis Forge requires to function._

Steps to Upgrade:
1. Shutdown oasis Core
2. (Optional) Delete "oasis-qt" from your device
3. [Download oasis Core v2.1.0](https://github.com/gdiscord/oasis/releases)
4. Open "oasis-qt"
5. **Upgrade Complete!**
